###Scalable Design approach
# Overview
.NetBlocks is an opinionated design pattern and complementary architecture


The objective of the .NetBlocks design is to create building blocks that form a pattern or recipe that is easy for any engineer to follow. This allows the engineer to focus on implementing the business logic to solve business problems in an architecture that "just works".

The design patterns in .NetBlocks rely heavily on existing an up and coming cloud and asynchronous processing technologies.

## Business Logic
Engineers in large organizations and enterprises are focused on delivering value by solving the business problem, not playing with technology. The design patterns, practices and technologies they use should solve the technical problems without requiring deep thought so the focus is on the business problem.
