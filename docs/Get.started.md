Excerpt: How to get going with .NetBlocks
--->

## Let's Get started!
.Net blocks provides quick solutions to specific problems or it gives you an entire framework, design and philosophy to rapidly build scalable, maintainable and business solution focused software. The direction you choose is up to you and your needs.

## Point solutions - [Libraries](/Libraries)

.NetBlocks contains point solutions you can use on their own to solve a particular problem without taking on the enterprise design and philosophy.
Each library is available as a seperate nuget for your use so you don't bloat your existing code just to solve one problem.
The [Libraries section](/Libraries) has information to get you going.


## Enterprise solution - [Design](/Design) and [Libraries](/Libraries)

The enterprise solution is an opinoinated design philosophy and pattern to create an event based, highly scalable enterprise solution. It provides a quick and reliable way to build a solution that can self-heal, isolates business logic and is deployable in a variety of patterns. The [design](/Design)section explains the enterprise pattern and how it works.

You can use the individual .NetBlocks to solve your problems, just like any other library, or you can follow the overall philosophy and start creating enterprise level scalable code. Its your choice.

## Getting to the good stuff (how to get the code)
[Libraries](/Libraries/): Each library is available via nuget and has documentation in the libraries section sinmilar to a standard component read me.
