Description: Shared objects defining all business components in the architecture and the basis for creating domain models.

# Overview

library contains all the contracts and models used or implemented by business classes libraries supporting the architecture.
The library is referenced by any system following the business logic pattern.
It forms the basis for the logic, operation business entity contracts.

Entities are business object models that can be serialized, transmitted or used in a persistance strategy (typically EF or blob storage);
Business entities are similar to data transfer objects in older n-tier paradigms.

# Abstract base and Generic derived class problem
This article explains the design pattern for derived classes.

#Keying strategies

storing, retrieving and uniquely identifying objects requires an identification system. The identifiers are called keys, with a subset of keys being called ids.

The framework makes a keyed business entity available for use.

1. Keyed entities - generic class allowing a key type during closure.

Key or ID types

For performance reasons, data bases and other repository types prefer sequential increased identifiers. numeric id types are preferred.

Disadvantage of numeric types is the ID cannot be allocated in advance, so it can only be generated during persistence. Numeric keys are not portable and are typically re-assigned when data is moved between repositories.

Global Identifiers (GUIDS) allow any system to generate an ID. Guids are a random number and the uniform distribution causes performance issues in most repository technologies.

GUIDS have the advantage of being portable, so data can be moved from system to system or correlated across multiple systems.

# Generating GUIDs
Alternate GUID generation algorithmns create semi-unique ever increasing numbers. This helps but doesn't mitigate the poor performance of GUIDS.
The algorithm recommended for the framework is the CombGuid algorithmn first created by Jimmmy Nilsson. The referenced nuget library for GUID generation gives framework users lots of options.

#Dual keying

The framework provides a dual keyed object using an ID field and an additional GlobalID to store a guid. This is a best of both worlds blend allowing portability between rpositories but performance within a single repository.

The entities are the BusinessEntity (ID) and the GlobalKeyedEntity (ID and Global ID);



# Business Entities

1. BusinessEntity - base class for business entities using for type closures
1. 2. KeyedEntity - Business Entity with a generic ID property
	1. GlobalKeyedEntity - Dual keyed entity with Generic ID property and a GUID Global ID (Recommended.)
	1. IAuditable Entities - versions of the entity types implementing the IAuditable interface and properties, so store data about the CRUD operations for auditing purposes.
